Multi-page responsive design
I am building a web page with multiple linked pages that is responsive to the resolution of different devices changing. I will be building several pages with with different layouts in HTML to create an efficient and stylish design. I will also use CSS to style these pages with color schemes and pictures to create attractive designs and enhance user experience.  --TBC--
